 style="font-weight: bold;">Gameplay</span></big></div>
      <div style="padding: 20px; text-align: justify;">You play as a 9
year old boy in
a game about his absolute dream: a world made of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">candies</span>! Your role is to guide
Nikwi through all the 30 levels, eat all the candies in each level and
avoid the monsters and the hazards that each level has. Nikwi has a
talent on jumping high - although his falls are not as good as he would
like - and this is his only <span style="font-style: italic;">armor</span>
against the monsters which try to turn his dream into a nightmare.<br>
      <br>
Every six levels, the theme changes (with five total themes) and the gameplay is
altered a bit. Every two levels or so, new monsters appear - monsters
which require different approaches to be taken in order to avoid them.<br>
      </div>
      <div style="background-color: black; color: white;"><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">System requirements<br>
      </span></big></div>
      <div style="padding: 20px; text-align: justify;">Nikwi requires
at least a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pentium 3</span> or later
CPU to work (it <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> work with
older CPUs, but the use of older CPUs than Pentium 3 is not recommended
and definitelly not supported) running at least at <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">600MHz</span>. It also requires a graphics
card that can support <span style="font-weight: bold;">640x480 with
16bits of color </span>(most cards that are available for Pentium 3
support this mode). Lastly, it requires at least <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">32MB of system RAM </span>memory.<br>
      <br>
For smooth gameplay, a CPU running at <span style="font-weight: bold;">2GHz
      </span>and a video card with <span style="font-weight: bold;">2D
acceleration</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">16MB of video
ram </span>is recommended. In order to take advantage of the 2D
acceleration, Nikwi must be run in fullscreen mode.<br>
      <br>
Nikwi requires <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows 2000</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Windows XP</span> or newer or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Linux with kernel 2.6</span> or newer. It
may work on other operating systems, but we cannot provide support for
them.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">For Linux users: </span>Nikwi
requires the latest version of SDL (has been tested and compiled with
SDL <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.2.9</span>). Most Linux
distributions include SDL, but if yours doesn't -or if the version
included is very old - visit <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">http://www.libsdl.org/</a>
to obtain it.<br>
      <br>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" noshade="noshade">Note: the
game <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">may not</span> run in order and weaker
systems than those mentioned above. In any case, the use in such
systems is discouraged and not supported. We will not be able to <br>

 style="font-weight: bold;">Game screens<br>
      </span></big></div>
      <div style="padding: 20px; text-align: justify;">The game
contains two main screens, the <span style="font-style: italic;">menu</span>
and the<span style="font-style: italic;"> game</span>:<br>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The menu</span><br>
          </span>The menu is the screen in which you enter when the
game starts. It contains three options, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">New Game,
Credits</span></span> and <span style="font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Quit</span></span>. You can use the arrows
keys <span style="font-style: italic;">up </span>and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">down </span>to select a menu option (two
bobbing candies appear at the left and at the right of the selected
option) and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Enter</span> key to
activate the selected option. The options act as follows:<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">New game</span> - This
option begins a new game. If you already have a game in the process and
you went to the menu by pressing ESC (see the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Controls</span> part of this manual
below), the current game is ended and a new game begins from the first
level.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Credits </span>- It
shows a screen with information about the game's developers.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quit</span> - It
immediatelly quits the game. The <span style="font-style: italic;">shareware
version</span> will show some teaser&nbsp; screenshots of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">full version </span>before quitting.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
game</span><br>
This is where all the fun takes place. In the game screen you see your
character, Nikwi, the monsters, the hazards, the candies and the
setting itself. For information about controlling Nikwi, see the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Controls</span> section below.</li>
      </ol>
Some screens -like the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Credits </span>screen-
wait from the user to press a key in order to dissappear and others
-like the logo screen at the beginning on the game- to wait for a few
seconds.<br>

 style="font-weight: bold;">Controls</span></big></div>
      <div style="padding: 20px; text-align: justify;">You control
Nikwi using the keyboard. The keys are presented in the table below:<br>

left/right<br>
            </td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">Make Nikwi walk to the
left or the right direction. If Nikwi is in the air, he turn to that
direction.<br>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

            </td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">Make Nikwi jump. Nikwi
needs to be on ground in order to jump, but he can also <span
 style="font-style: italic;">air-jump</span>: if he leaves the ground
without jumping (by falling), he can jump in the middle air. Mastering
air jumping will help the player to complete the game faster.<br>

            </td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">Restart level. If you get
stuck in a level or you think you can't go back, use F6 to restart the
level. There are unlimited times you can play a level, so don't feel
bad if you restart a level.<br>

            <td style="vertical-align: top;">Quick quit. If, for any
reason, you want to exit the game as quickly as possible, press F10 and
your wish will become true: the game will exit instantly, like if
nothing has happened. Note that the <span style="font-style: italic;">shareware
version </span>will pop a message reminding you to obtain the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">full
version</span>.<br>

      <div style="padding: 20px; text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Windows</span><br>
Q: The installer says a message like "Drive
or path not found" (or similar).<br>
A: </span>Please be sure that you run the installer from a drive where
you have full priviledges. Drive <span style="font-weight: bold;">C: </span>is&nbsp;
the ideal place to run the installer from.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Q: I have installed the game, but no icons were made in my desktop or
the Start menu.<br>
A: </span>Something went wrong during the installation. Try to
reinstall the game.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: Where is the game installed?</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>The game installs
itself at <code>C:\Slashstone\Games\Nikwi</code>.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: Can i move the game to a
different location?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Yes, but the desktop
and Start menu shortcuts will not work and if you want to remove it
from your system, you will have to manually delete the shortcuts and
the game files.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Q: When the game
starts, it says that the SDL.DLL is not available and exits.</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Your installation is
corrupted. Try to reinstall the game.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: The game is slow!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Check if your system
meets the minimum system requirements. If it does, try to update your
video card drivers. If you run the game in a window, try to run it in
fullscreen to take advantage of hardware acceleration.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Linux<br>
      </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: The binary says that a
.so file is missing.<br>
A: </span>Check if your system is missing any shared library and if it
includes SDL. Try to use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ldd</span>
command to see which shared objects the binary wants and try to locate
them.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: The game is slow!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Check your video card
drivers. Running the game in fullscreen <span
 style="font-style: italic;">may</span> solve the problem, but SDL
doesn't seem to take advantage of hardware acceleration under Linux.<br>
